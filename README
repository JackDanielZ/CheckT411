Goal: download torrents meta-files according to patterns given by the user.

This tool can be used to download automatically files by copying the torrent file into a specific directory that could be scanned by a bittorrent client

A config.lua file is needed to store the user configuration. Following an example:

-- Authentication in T411 website
username = "my_t411_username"
password = "my_t411_password"

-- Path to the directory where to store the .torrent files.
-- If not specified or nil, will be set to the current directory
download_dir = "/home/user/Downloads/Torrents"

-- Patterns to determine which torrents to consider
patterns = {
   {
      pattern = "Revenge", -- target name begins with Revenge
      min_size = 300,      -- minimum size of the target is 300M
      max_size = 400       -- maximum size of the target is 400M
   },
   {
      pattern = "Turn.*SUBFRENCH" -- regex can be used to describe the target name
   }
}
